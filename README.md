HC-12 configuration utility

Version: R6

Small win32 utility to configure the HC-12 Wireless Serial Port Communication Module. Module should be attached to a USB to TTL serial bridge, with the SET pin tied to ground. If the SET pin is grounded before power is applied, the module will default back to the required 9600 baud.
